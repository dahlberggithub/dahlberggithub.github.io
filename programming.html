    <p class="regular">
        Together with my two coauthors, Stephanie van Willigenburg and Angele Foley, we resolved a 20-year-old conjecture by Richard Stanley, a leader of combinatorics.

                "We donâ€™t know of a graph which is not contractible to K<sub>13</sub> (even regarding multiple edges of a contraction as a single edge) which is not <i>e</i>-positive." <br>
                -- Richard Stanley

    <p class="regular">
        By developeing Python code (specifically in SageMath) to we analyzed graphs with specific properties, those graphs that were claw-free, claw-contractible-free and also not <i>e</i>-positive. A full search was impossible due to time complexity. However, we optimized by targeting likely graphs and ultimately produced a counterexample! We published the results in a top academic journal that  received  over 35 citations, and earned the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) David P. Robbins Prize.

        In this project you can upload an image and turn it into a mystery mosaic. This is a grid of boxes with numbers and a key to decode those numbers into colors. Color the boxes as indicated and discover the picture.
